# KET UNIT6

## 1. Grammar

* Somebody have/has to do sth. (某人必须做某事)
> You have to clean bedroom at weekend.

* Somebody don’t/doesn't have/has to do sth. (某人不必做某事)
> You don’t have to clean bedroom at weekend.

* Do/Does you have to do sth. (某人必须做某事吗?)
> Do you have to clean bedroom at weekend?

关键语法点：

* to 后面一定要接动词原形
* 当主语是第三人称单数时，要用 has to do sth
* 当主语是第三人称单数时，疑问句是 do/does 的变换，不是 have/has 的变化

称代词的主格、宾格形式:

| 人称     | 主格        | 宾格         |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| 第一人称单数 | I         | me         |
| 第二人称单数 | you       | you        |
| 第三人称单数 | he/she/it | him/her/it |
| 第一人称复数 | we        | us         |
| 第二人称复数 | you       | you        |
| 第三人称复数 | they      | them       |
